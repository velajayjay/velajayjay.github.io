				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am a fourth-year undergrad student in Biochemistry at UCSD. I plan on continuing my education through either graduate school to become a researcher or through medical school in order to become a radiation oncologist.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p>I have not done any projects that are related to my majors however I have worked in both a hospital and a labratory setting. In the hospital, I worked as a scribe by doing paperwork, entering new patients, as well as various responsibilities that are similar to that of a nurse. In the lab, I worked on both biomedical and biological experiments focusing on viruses and genetic engineering.</p>
